  Whereby Embedded allows your participants to join a video meeting without
  creating accounts or logins. If you want some users to have altered privileges
  in the meeting, you can use different URL types

# User roles and privileges

### Hosts

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RicAdlE93cc" %}

Users joining via the hostRoomURL become meeting hosts and have the following features available:

* Lock and unlock the room.
* Enter locked rooms without knocking.
* [Respond and allow access](https://whereby.helpscoutdocs.com/article/464-lock-knock) to participants that are knocking.
* Remove, mute, and spotlight meeting participants.
* Start and stop [recordings](customizing-rooms/recording-with-embedded/), if available.
* Start and stop [breakout groups](customizing-rooms/breakout-groups-with-embedded.md), if available.

{% hint style="info" %}
Host privileges are valid immediately on room creation and are disabled one hour after the `endDate`.
{% endhint %}

A hostRoomURL is only available if the `hostRoomURL` is included in the `fields` parameter when [creating the room via the API](creating-and-deleting-rooms/using-the-rest-api.md).

**Example request body:**

```json
{
    "endDate": "2099-03-25T13:30:00.000Z",
    "fields": ["hostRoomUrl"]
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
    "meetingId": "1234",
    "startDate": "2022-03-09T13:50:00.000Z",
    "endDate": "2099-03-25T13:30:00.000Z",
    "roomUrl": "https://example.whereby.com/room",
    "hostRoomUrl": "https://example.whereby.com/room?roomKey=eFhcG...i00ZG"
}
```

Now that you have both a `roomUrl` and a `hostRoomUrl`, you can ensure that both your guests and hosts get the right privileges by using the corresponding URL when [embedding rooms](embedding-rooms/) in your own webpage or app.

### Participants

Users joining via the standard `roomUrl` will have a more typical meeting experience. They will only have access to the features you've set via [URL parameters](customizing-rooms/using-url-parameters.md) or the [dashboard](customizing-rooms/dashboard-preferences.md), and they will need to knock to gain entry to locked rooms.

A `roomUrl` will be included with any POST [meeting creation](https://whereby.dev/http-api/#/paths/\~1meetings/post) requests.



**Example request body:**

```javascript
{ 
    "endDate": "2099-03-25T13:30:00.000Z", 
}
```

#### Response:

```javascript
{
    "meetingId": "1234",
    "startDate": "2022-03-09T13:50:00.000Z",
    "endDate": "2099-03-25T13:30:00.000Z",
    "roomUrl": "https://example.whereby.com/room",
}
```

### Viewers

In Viewer Mode, participants joining as Viewers have their camera and microphone access disabled. Viewers can gain access to locked rooms without knocking and can only interact with Hosts and Participants by using the Chat, if you've enabled that in the room.

This is a 1.0 feature and might change in the future.

{% hint style="success" %}
Meetings created in "[group](creating-and-deleting-rooms/#using-the-rest-api)" mode can support up to 200 hosts or participants. Viewer mode can support an additional 400 viewers for a total of 600 viewers, hosts, and participants.&#x20;
{% endhint %}



**Example request body:**

```json
{
    "endDate": "2099-03-25T13:30:00.000Z",
    "templateType": "viewerMode"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
    "meetingId": "1234",
    "startDate": "2022-03-09T13:50:00.000Z",
    "endDate": "2099-03-25T13:30:00.000Z",
    "roomUrl": "https://example.whereby.com/room",
    "hostRoomUrl": "https://example.whereby.com/room?roomKey=eFhcG...i00ZG"
    "viewerRoomUrl": "https://example.whereby.com/room?roomKey=eFhcG...VTQIE"
}
```
