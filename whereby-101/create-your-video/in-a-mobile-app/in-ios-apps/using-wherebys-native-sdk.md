# Using Whereby's Native SDK

The Whereby iOS SDK is available through [Swift Package Manager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app), [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) and can also be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/whereby/ios-sdk). It enables you to integrate Whereby as a native iOS component using Xcode, and allows you to hook into powerful features such as listening to room events and sending commands to the room from the host application.&#x20;

To get started, check out the [SDK documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/whereby/ios-sdk) and play around with our [iOS demo app](https://github.com/whereby/ios-sdk-demo).
