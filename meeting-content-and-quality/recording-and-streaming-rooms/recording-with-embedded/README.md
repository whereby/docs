# Recording with Embedded

### Cloud Recording

Cloud recording allows you to record your meetings and store those files in a cloud storage bucket. You can choose to store the recording files in Whereby-provided storage or in external storage owned and managed by you and your organization. &#x20;

Currently we only support Amazon S3 as the external storage for cloud recordings. You can review their plans and pricing on the [AWS site](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).&#x20;
