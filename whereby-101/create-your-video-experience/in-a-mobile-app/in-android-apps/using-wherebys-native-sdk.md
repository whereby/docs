# Using Whereby's Native SDK

The Whereby Android SDK is [available through Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/#whereby/android-sdk) and can also be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/whereby/android-sdk). It loads the Whereby web component through a WebView, integrates with your editor to make it easier to customize the Whereby Embedded experience, and allows you to hook into powerful features such as listening to room events and sending commands to the room from the host application.&#x20;

To get started, check out the [SDK documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/whereby/android-sdk) and play around with our [Android demo app](https://github.com/whereby/android-sdk-demo).&#x20;
