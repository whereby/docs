# Camera Effects Reference

The **Whereby Camera Effects SDK** is the low-level foundation for applying real-time visual effects to camera streams within the Whereby ecosystem. It provides a set of predefined images and videos that can be used as background effects on an existing video stream. It's meant to be used alongside Whereby's other SDK's, like the React Hooks browser SDK, or Whereby Core.&#x20;

### Use Case
