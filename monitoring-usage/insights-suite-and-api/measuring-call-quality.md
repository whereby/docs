# Measuring call quality

## Using Insights dashboard charts

The [participant packet loss and bitrate usage charts](https://docs.whereby.com/monitoring-usage/insights-suite-and-api/using-the-insights-dashboard#reading-the-charts) in the Insights Dashboard will give you an indication if they encountered any issues and what those issues may have been.&#x20;

## Using participant ratings (in beta)

Whereby has a call ratings feature in beta that you can ask us to turn on for your account.

If you have this feature turned on, each participant will be asked at the end of their call to rate the call quality, and you can track these ratings in a dashboard will will provide to you. Contact Whereby to get this feature enabled.
