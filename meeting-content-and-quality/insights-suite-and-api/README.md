# Quality Insights

You can quickly get a clear understanding of what's happening over time and see the big picture, or get a more granular view for data points like:

* 📈 How many Participant, Recording and Live Streaming minutes have been used
* 👨‍💻 The number of sessions/meetings happening over time
* 👥 How many participants have joined video calls
* :woman\_technologist:Each participant's call quality experience

![Visit the "Insights" section of your Whereby Embedded account to access these reports. ](<../../.gitbook/assets/Insights Dashboard.png>)

To access the Insights suite, log in to your Whereby Embedded account and visit the "Insights" section.

You can also query the Insights suite data through the [Whereby REST API](../../reference/whereby-rest-api-reference/#get-meetings), which allows you to programmatically use it for things like billing, operations, or even to create a dashboard of your own.
