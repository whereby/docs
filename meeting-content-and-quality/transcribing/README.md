# Transcribing

{% hint style="info" %}
Transcription is a supplementary feature of our paid Whereby Embedded plans. You can review the pricing and options [on our site](https://whereby.com/information/embedded/pricing/).
{% endhint %}

Session transcripts can be used as a standalone resource (eg. for compliance purposes) or sent to an external service for post processing (eg. to derive key topics or create a session summary). You can create transcripts directly from the session (without the need to record it) or you can transcribe any session recording saved in [Whereby-provided storage](../recording-with-embedded/cloud-recording.md#whereby-provided-storage). Transcripts are saved as text files accessible through the customer portal or via [the API](../../reference/whereby-rest-api-reference/transcriptions.md).&#x20;
