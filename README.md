# Getting started with Whereby Embedded

### Creating and deleting rooms

Rooms are where video calls take place. They can be created with a simple API call from your own backend, or by using tools such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). All rooms have unique URLs and can be created ahead of time or on demand.

### Customizing rooms

Customize the meeting experience and control the features that are available to your participants. This can be done in several ways: through the API as the room is created, by using URL parameters when embedding it, or via dashboard settings.

### Monitoring usage

It can be helpful to have an understanding of how much usage your rooms are experiencing. Our ready-to-use Insights Dashboard requires no setup and gives instant access to essential metrics and visualizations, but you can also set up your own tracking using our webhooks or other mechanisms.

### User roles and privileges

Whereby Embedded allows your participants to join a video meeting without creating accounts or logins. If you want some users to have elevated privileges in the meeting, you can use hostRoomURLs.
