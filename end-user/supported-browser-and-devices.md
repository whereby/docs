# Supported Browser & Devices

As a browser-based platform, we're able to support any operating system that's capable of running one of our supported browsers.&#x20;

Whether it's macOS, Linux, or Windows, we've got you covered as long as you can run an up-to-date and supported browser!

## Desktop Browsers

All of the below browsers have full support for WebRTC. For the best experience, we recommend Chrome or Chromium-based browsers such as Edge, Vivaldi, Opera, Brave or Arc.

With consistently updating browsers and web API's, **we're committed to supporting the two latest versions of each of the support browsers listed below.**

{% hint style="success" %}
Older versions of the below browsers will generally work as they support the basics of [WebRTC](https://caniuse.com/rtcpeerconnection). However, users may have a degraded experience due to newer browser level APIs and bug fixes.&#x20;

If your users are experiencing problems, instruct them to update their browser as a first step. We recommend testing on older devices when possible, if you expect your user base to use predominately out of date software.&#x20;
