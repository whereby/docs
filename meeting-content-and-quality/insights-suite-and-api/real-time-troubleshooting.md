# Real-time troubleshooting

### Summary

Video meetings depend on various factors. Some of them are within users' control - but only if they are aware of them. Typical root causes of audio and video issues include:

* Poor or unstable internet connection
* High CPU usage due to intensive software processes, running several applications at once, having numerous open browser tabs, or even aging device hardware

In order to help users deal with these issues, we provide a suite of real-time troubleshooting tools featuring:

* [Meeting diagnostics](real-time-troubleshooting.md#meeting-diagnostics)
* [Detection of poor network conditions](real-time-troubleshooting.md#detection-of-poor-network-conditions)
* Actionable tips for smoother meetings
* Mode to conserve bandwidth and optimize audio quality by disabling videos

These tools allows participants and hosts to troubleshoot connection issues during calls, aiming to reduce your team’s support tickets and ensure high-quality experiences.&#x20;

3.  Meeting participants with poor network conditions will appear with an indicator on their video tile. This helps other participants understand why the affected participant's audio or video quality is lower.\
