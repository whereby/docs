  Some key properties of your rooms should be set when the room is created using
  the API.

# On creation

The roomâ€™s initial **lock state**, the **pattern of the room name** used in the URL and the **room size** (maximum number of participants) can all be determined at the time of creation.

Have a look at our [API reference](../whereby-rest-api-reference.md) for a complete overview of properties that can be set on meeting creation.

Further customizations can be done after the room has been created, either by using [URL parameters](using-url-parameters.md) when embedding the room, [managing preferences via the dashboard](dashboard-preferences.md), or by customizing [branding elements](branding-elements.md) like background and logo.
