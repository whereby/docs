# Live Captions

{% hint style="info" %}
Live captions are currently in closed Beta and available to selected customers only. Email us at embedded@whereby.com to join our beta testing program (terms and conditions apply).
{% endhint %}

Live captions automatically generate real-time text on the screen of a meeting room during the meeting itself. It usually focuses on key spoken content and may not include every single word, like filler words.&#x20;

Primarily used for real-time accessibility, helping participants follow along as the meeting progresses without needing to listen to the audio.

{% hint style="info" %}
Live captions is a supplementary feature of our paid Whereby Embedded plans. You can review the pricing and options [on our site](https://whereby.com/information/embedded/pricing/).

{% hint style="info" %}
_What is an unmuted participant minute?_ This is calculated using the number of participants who are unmuted during a call. For example, a 60 minute meeting containing 2 people who are unmuted for the whole meeting would use 120 unmuted participant minutes. Alternatively, a 60 minute meeting with 3 participants, where only 2 participants were unmuted and the third participant was muted for the whole meeting, would also use 120 unmuted participant minutes. From the moment a participant is unmuted, this usage counts towards the number of unmuted participant minutes, even if they do not actively talk or engage on the call.
